TO PLAY:

Either run "Connect4.java"'s main, 
or click on the "285 p5.jar" file provided.

The two players will click on either the "Host a game" or "Join a game" button on the welcome screen, but the host MUST finish setting up first.

The person joining a game will be prompted for the host's IP address, this can be found on the top message "banner" on the host's window after they finish setting up. If they are running on the same machine, the person joining the game may simply leave the field blank, and the IP address will be defaulted to localhost.


PLAYING THE GAME

A move is played by clicking on the button above the column the user wishes to play. A piece of the player's unique color will be "dropped" to the lowest available spot. The player will only be able to click on the buttons when it is their turn. The players alternate turns after every valid move.

The host (always red) will play first initially, and the players will compete until one makes a 4-in-a-row and wins the game. Or, until the board is full and there is a tie.

If someone wins, the users will be prompted to play again. If they both accept, the loser of the previous game will play first in this new one.

If there is a tie, they will both be prompted to play again, and whoever played first on this game will start the new one.

There is a chat box on the left, where users may send messages to each other. Messages can be sent by pressing the Enter key or by clicking "Send."

Good Luck!
